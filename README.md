AI-Driven Hypothesis Refinement System
1. Introduction
This project is an AI-driven hypothesis refinement system that uses web data extraction and iterative learning to generate, refine, and rank hypotheses. The system employs multiple specialized agents and a memory system to improve results over multiple cycles.

2. Problem Statement & Objective
The goal is to develop a system that can:

Generate hypotheses based on user queries
Retrieve relevant information using SerpAPI (Google Search)
Rank hypotheses based on relevance and refine them iteratively
Store and recall past results to avoid redundant searches
Select the best refined hypothesis using an AI-driven approach
Problem Description

Design a system where:

Specialized Agents have distinct roles: Generation, Reflection, Ranking, Evolution, Proximity, and Meta-review.
A Supervisor Agent: Assigns tasks, allocates resources, and enables feedback loops.
The system stores and retrieves interactions and extracts real-time web data.
Requirements

Implement a storage/retrieval system (e.g., dictionary with "query: solar, output: 9/10").
Simulate the six agents and Supervisor.
Add real-time web extraction (e.g., scrape a site or use an API like Google Search).
Show feedback-driven improvement over 2â€“3 cycles.
Demo processing a sample input (e.g., "urban energy solutions").
3. System Architecture
The system consists of the following core components:

a. Memory System: Stores past queries and their results in an SQLite database. Retrieves previously searched queries to optimize processing time.

b. Supervisor Agent: Manages multiple specialized agents. Controls the iterative process of hypothesis refinement.

c. AI Agents:

Generation Agent: Creates an initial hypothesis based on user input.
Reflection Agent: Evaluates and improves the hypothesis.
Ranking Agent: Assigns a score (1-10) based on search result quality.
Evolution Agent: Modifies the hypothesis to improve ranking.
Proximity Agent: Compares queries to past searches to avoid repetition.
Meta-Review Agent: Selects the best hypothesis after multiple iterations.
d. Web Scraper: Uses SerpAPI to fetch real-time search results. Extracts titles, links, and snippets from search pages.

4. Implementation Details
a. Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.
SQLite: Stores previous queries and results.
SerpAPI: Fetches real-time Google Search results.
Matplotlib: Visualizes hypothesis ranking improvements.
b. Execution Flow

User enters a research topic (e.g., "Quantum Computing").
The system checks past searches (if exists, retrieves stored result).
If no stored data is found, the Generation Agent creates a hypothesis.
Web scraping fetches real-time data, and the Ranking Agent scores it.
The Evolution Agent refines the hypothesis for the next iteration.
After multiple cycles, the Meta-Review Agent selects the best result.
The system stores the best hypothesis in memory for future queries.
5. Features & Benefits
AI-driven hypothesis refinement: Achieves better results through iterative learning.
Avoids redundant searches: Utilizes memory storage for efficiency.
Real-time web data extraction: Ensures the latest information is used.
Visualization of ranking trends: Allows tracking of improvement over iterations.
Multi-cycle iterative learning: Enhances research accuracy over time.
How It Works
Multi-Agent System: Generates, evaluates, ranks, and refines hypotheses dynamically.
AI-Driven Search & Ranking: Prioritizes relevance, credibility, and recency over just listing results.
Memory-driven reasoning: Ensures efficiency by avoiding redundant queries and learning from past searches.
Automated hypothesis refinement: Mimics structured decision-making, making the system smarter over time.
Memory-Based Learning: Avoids redundant searches by retrieving past insights.
Meta-Review Agent: Selects the best refined hypothesis automatically.
Key Differentiators
Citing Sources for Transparency: Every result includes the title, link, and snippet.
Avoiding Duplicate Searches: Saves time and resources by reusing past results.
Smarter Ranking System: Ensures high-quality insights instead of ranking by count.
